Worksheet 4


Goals:
• Tools to support collaborative code development
• Collaborative work


Exercise
UPT needs a software to manage the car park. The application must:

• Give access to the park to all students

• Account parking time and the amount to be paid (consider that every 15 minutes
the student pays €0.10)

• Parking time must be saved in a file as well as the amount paid by the student

• The park has a capacity of 500 places. Once completed, the user must be
informed

• In addition to student data, the car license plate must also be stored for security
reasons.

• To simulate reading, use Scanner

• Every month, the student who paid more for parking has a 10% discount for the
next month (optional)


To create this application collaboratively, follow these steps:

• Forms a group of 4/5 elements

• Choose the project leader (scrum master)

• The project leader creates a GitHub repository

• Contributors clone the same project

• Study and discuss the problem with your colleagues

• Divide tasks. Each student must develop a component of the application

• Create branches for each user

• Push, pull and merge established tasks

• The project leader must be responsible for reviewing the code and merging it
into the master branch

• It makes use of pull requests available on GitHub. These must also be managed
by the project leader.

• Keep the solution properly commented
Note: Consider that you only have around 1h30 to solve the exercise. Keep it simple. If
in doubt about any requirements, make assumptions! The scrum master of each group
must place the URL of the respective GitHub project in the Excel sheet available in
Moodle. Regardless of the state of the code, enter the URL!!!!
Good job!
